# Hi, I am Thomas 

## Summary
Young bioinformatics engineer and eager to learn. I am gradually specializing in genomics and cancer biology. I wish to be able to contribute as much as I can to academic research. I am always curious about innovations in science. Otherwise, I also like sports, cooking and art.

## Projects

### Bulk RNAseq

[DESeq wrapper](https://github.com/thms3/DESeq_wrapper): wrapper functions to simplify the implementation of differential expression analysis with DESeq

[edgeR_wrapper](https://github.com/thms3/edgeR_wrapper): wrapper functions to simplify the implementation of differential expression analysis with  edgeR

[heatmap_edgeR_DESeq](https://github.com/thms3/heatmap_edgeR_DESeq): heatmap for RNAseq differential expression analysis with edgeR or DESeq objects 

[edgeR_plot_post](https://github.com/thms3/edgeR_plot_post): conversion of plot edgeR into object ggplot with the addition of visualization of selected genes to allow a posteriori evaluation of results 

[meanSdPlot_post](https://github.com/thms3/meanSdPlot_post): wrapper of the vsn:meanSdPlot function with the addition of a selected gene visualization 

[annotation_bulk](https://github.com/thms3/annotation_bulk): functions to annotate bulk RNAseq datasets from the annotationhub package which allows to keep the gene or transcript annotation files up to date
